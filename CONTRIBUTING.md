# Guidelines for contribution of new pipelines

> [!TIP]
> The process of submitting a pipeline for inclusion is done entirely through the review of
> a pull request. Most of the pre-review checklist is codified in the "New pipeline" issue
> template. Submissions of new pipelines that do not use this template will not be merged.
